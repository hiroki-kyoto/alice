# Alice
Target: Creating the first **REAL AI** with self consciousness.

Routine: 
1. Unsupervised Learning by free access to tons of resources in the air.
2. Supervised Learning by proactive feedback observation. 
3. Only one objective is given: survival.

Main ideas:
1. AI is more like a **CLOSE LOOP CONTROL**, with iterative adjustment 
during each inference, other than an open loop 
single shot processor.
2. AI learns generic knowledge from various observation, 
the goal for it is to figure out the **THEORIES THAT DO NOT CHANGE**
3. Effective learning requires generation iteration and fundamental 
neural form evolution. 
Like Ticket Hypothesis, **TWO TIME-SCALEs** are required in learning,
the coarse scale learns the basic graph linkage,
the fine scale learns the extract weights for 
**transferring environment**.
